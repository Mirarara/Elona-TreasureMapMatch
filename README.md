# Elona-TreasureMapMatch
Match the snipped treasure location image with the North Tyris world map.

## Installation
1) Install python 3.11.0
2) run install.bat to install requirements (if you know what you are doing you can skip this and install the required module yourself).

## Usage
1) Use Win+shift+S to snip the treasure map image. (Remember to not have Elona as the active windows, since pressing shift will close the map).
2) Run Match.py
3) Enjoy.

Note: This works with North Tyris of Elona+ only. You may want to get your own map file and edit the filename in the script for other places.

### Examples of snipped image. (Without the brown part, don't have to be entire treasure map, just more than 3x3 tile is fine)
